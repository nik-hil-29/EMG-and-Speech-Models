# EMG-and-Speech-Models
This repository contains Signal Processing , Machine Learning Model  for Emg and Speech Command Recognition.
The emg signal processing is done using the neurokit2 library and Model for emg gesture classification is done using the BI-LSTM with attention mechanism.
The Speech command Recognition System is Built using Long Short Term Memory for the 7 class command classification.
